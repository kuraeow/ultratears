"""Per-instruction replacements applied by gen.py: guest address -> function(gen, addr) returning C code.

Every patch checks the original instruction word first, so lifting another game version (or a different build)
fails loudly instead of changing the wrong code. Runtime switches live in src/gfx/nvn/hle_nvn.c.

    recent frame times and returns {scale (float), state} to the renderer (main+0x581968), which turns the scale into
    the scene size (+0xccc). Its first test is the controller's enable bit (+0x110 bit 0); with the bit clear it
    takes its own disabled path (main+0x584c3c): scale 1.0, history untouched. The patch takes that path unless
    TOTK_DRS=1. Why: the game flips the scene targets between 1600x896 and 1432x808 over the same memory and our
    per-size images then hand stale content to the other size (terrain gone, clouds over the scene);
    image quality is better at a fixed size and upscaling will come from FSR."""
